Welcome!

Superrr is a meetup for women*. 
Host one in your city and send us a pull request!

How to:
The rules are simple: ~ Cool Women. A Bar. Drinks. ~ No Agenda. No Men*. No Bullshit. ~
Pick a venue and invite some cool women you know - tell everyone to bring a +1

------

Background:  for a while now, we’ve been wanting to organise an event to bring together the cool women we know, but we couldn’t quite get round to a proper concept… so, we thought, the best way to start would be simply to find a bar and some cool women.

Why: There are so many intelligent and great women out there, and we rarely get to hang out as a big group without some kind of theme, formal talks, corporate sponsorship, or overbearing men. We want nothing formal, no theme, no agenda, just chatting, meeting new people (and cocktails, if you so wish). 







* gender labels are, of course, subject to your own desire for identification (or not!)
