We are at CCCamp! Come by, grab a drink, hang out with like-minded women* and bring a friend to diversify our crowd! Women* from various backgrounds (art, science, tech, music ... whatever floats your boat!) meet at a bar to chat, exchange ideas and to just have a nice evening together. 

For more details about time and meetup spot: drop Frederike or Elisa a message!
