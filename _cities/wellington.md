Come by, grab a drink, hang out with like-minded women* and bring a friend to diversify our crowd! Women* from various backgrounds (art, science, tech, music ... whatever floats your boat!) meet at a bar to chat, exchange ideas and to just have a nice evening together.
No agenda. No men*. No bullshit. ;)

Please feel free to bring a +1 to extend the group.
